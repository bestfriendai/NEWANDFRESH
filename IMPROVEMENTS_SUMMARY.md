2. ‚úÖ Fixed critical memory management issues
3. ‚úÖ Added preview connection error handling
4. ‚úÖ Improved error feedback to users
5. ‚úÖ Verified synchronizer delegate is properly registered
6. ‚úÖ All builds passing

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Memory Management ‚úÖ FIXED

**Issue:** High-frequency frame processing methods lacked autorelease pools, causing memory buildup during recording.

**Impact:** Memory could grow unbounded during long recordings, potentially causing app crashes or system slowdown.

**Fix Applied:**
```swift
// File: AVCam/Capture/DualMovieRecorder.swift

func processSynchronizedFrames(...) {
    autoreleasepool {  // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ADDED
        // All frame processing now happens within autorelease pool
    }
}

private func composeFrames(...) -> CVPixelBuffer? {
    autoreleasepool {  // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ADDED
        // All Core Image operations now happen within autorelease pool
    }
}
```

**Result:** Memory is now properly released after each frame, preventing buildup.

---

### 2. Preview Connection Error Handling ‚úÖ FIXED

**Issue:** Preview connection setup errors were not surfaced to the user, potentially causing black screens.

**Impact:** Users would see a black screen without knowing what went wrong.

**Fixes Applied:**

**A. Added error tracking to Camera protocol and models:**
```swift
// Added to Camera protocol
var isDualPreviewFailed: Bool { get }

// Added to CameraModel
private(set) var isDualPreviewFailed = false
```

**B. Enhanced error handling in setupDualPreviewConnections:**
```swift
func setupDualPreviewConnections(...) async {
    do {
        try await captureService.setupPreviewConnections(...)
        isDualPreviewFailed = false  // Success!
        logger.info("‚úÖ Dual preview connections setup successfully")
    } catch {
        logger.error("‚ùå Failed to setup dual preview connections")
        isDualPreviewFailed = true  // Track failure
        self.error = error
    }
}
```

**C. Added user-facing error overlay in CameraView:**
```swift
if camera.isMultiCamMode && camera.isDualPreviewFailed {
    MultiCamErrorView(
        message: "Failed to connect dual camera previews..."
    ) {
        // Error recovery UI
    }
}
```

**Result:** Users now see a clear error message if preview setup fails, instead of a black screen.

### 3. Verified Synchronizer Registration ‚úÖ VERIFIED

**Audit Finding:** Initial audit mistakenly reported synchronizer wasn't registered.

**Actual Status:** ‚úÖ **CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED**

The synchronizer IS properly set up:
- Method `setupSynchronizer()` exists at line 923
- It IS called from `configureMultiCamSession()` at line 184
- Delegate IS strongly retained in `dualRecordingDelegate` property
- Both video and audio delegates are properly registered

**Code:**
```swift
private func setupSynchronizer() {
    // Create delegate - CORRECTLY retained
    let delegate = DualRecordingDelegate(captureService: self)
    self.dualRecordingDelegate = delegate  // ‚úÖ Strong reference
    
    // Create and configure synchronizer
    let synchronizer = AVCaptureDataOutputSynchronizer(dataOutputs: [backOutput, frontOutput])
    synchronizer.setDelegate(delegate, queue: synchronizerQueue)
    self.synchronizer = synchronizer
    
    // Setup audio delegate
    audioOutput?.setSampleBufferDelegate(delegate, queue: synchronizerQueue)
}
```

**Result:** Dual recording WILL work correctly - synchronizer is properly configured.
