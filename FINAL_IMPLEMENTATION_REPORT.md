                                         ├→ AVCaptureDataOutputSynchronizer
Front Camera → AVCaptureVideoDataOutput ─┘            ↓
                                              DualMovieRecorder (Actor)
                                                       ↓
                                            Core Image Compositor
                                            (Split-screen layout)
                                                       ↓
